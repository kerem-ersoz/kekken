A little 2D fighting game engine designed to be easily extensible and portable. 

## to compile on linux:
Just pull SDL2, SDL_image, and SDL_ttf using your favorite package manager. If you happen to be on Arch Linux, this should do the trick:

```sudo pacman -Syu sdl2 sdl2_image sdl2_ttf```

## macOS: 
Download the required .framework files:
SDL2: http://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php#source

SDL_image: https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/ 

SDL_ttf: https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/

Unpack and copy the frameworks into /Library/Frameworks/.

## Windows:
Coming soon!

### TO DO: 
Genetic algo vs. Q-learning agent!
